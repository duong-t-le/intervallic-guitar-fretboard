# intervallic-guitar-fretboard
Tool for practicing guitar interval knowledge.

Blue note(s) will appear on the fretboard which will represent a note at a particular octave. Click on the fretboard based on the interval being asked in direct relation to the key root.

Future State:
* Web Audio tuner to allow guitar to provide answers. Seems wonky. Notes seem to be off by a semitone.
* Show and play chord in order to allow you to decide the interval to use
* Common chord progressions to iterate over
